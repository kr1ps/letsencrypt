![](http://kr1ps.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/navigate-to-start-letter-k-sign-180x180.png)

Hi, this repo contain an implementation of the [linuxserver/letsencrypt](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/letsencrypt/). 


With this implementation I can make a reverse proxy of all my internal web services through https with an automatic certbot for my domain.

Enjoy  :)
